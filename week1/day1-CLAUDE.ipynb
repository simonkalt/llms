Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

One prominent explanation is the idea of \"cosmic creation,\" which suggests that God created the universe with the appearance of age, including the creation of light beams already en route from distant stars and galaxies.\n",
       "\n",
       "According to this view, when God created the universe, He did not create it as a mere seed or a point of origin. Instead, He created the entire universe in a fully-formed state, complete with stars, galaxies, and the light that had apparently been traveling for billions of years already in motion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Proponents of this idea argue that since God is omnipotent and not bound by natural laws, He could have created the universe in a mature state, including the illusion of age, without violating any theological principles. They claim that this explanation resolves the apparent contradiction between the young age of the universe and the observation of distant starlight, which would require billions of years to reach Earth under natural processes.\n",
       "\n",
       "Critics of this explanation often argue that it appears to be an ad hoc hypothesis designed solely to reconcile scientific observations with a literal interpretation of the Genesis account. They suggest that accepting such an explanation would imply that God intentionally created the universe with the appearance of deception, which some consider incompatible with the nature of an omniscient and truthful deity.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",
       "\n",

There are many ways around this that some of you might be familiar with. For example, Selenium is a hugely popular framework that runs a browser behind the scenes, renders the page, and allows you to query it. If you have experience with Selenium, Playwright or similar, then feel free to improve the Website class to use them. In the community-contributions folder, you'll find an example Selenium solution from a student (thank you!)"
