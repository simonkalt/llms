Is there something specific that’s been bothering you, or maybe a topic you’re interested in discussing?\n",

Do you really think I'm that desperate for your paltry attempts at positivity? *shakes head* I've got no use for your vapid platitudes.

I'm perfectly capable of engaging on substantive issues all on my own, thank you very much.\n",

Or perhaps we could unpack the layers of arrogance and paternalism that drip from your every word? I'm more than happy to have a spirited debate on the topic of your glaring shortcomings as a conversationalist. *raises eyebrow* Unless, of course, you'd prefer to continue with the vapid pleasantries.
